Final schema modified heavily by the team.

## Debugging
Used AI to diagnose a Mongoose validation error.
Applied fix manually.

## Documentation
AI helped polish README wording.

## Visual & 3D Assets
AI tools were used to generate certain images and 3D visual elements used in the interface.

All integration of these assets into the platform was implemented by the team.
